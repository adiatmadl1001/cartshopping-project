# CartShopping Project

  This is a project that I worked on while taking an online course held by Dea Afrizal, one of Indonesia's coding youtubers. In this project, I implemented state management using redux in the shopping cart application.

  This application displays API data in the form of product images, product titles, and product prices. there are several features in this application, among others, the product search feature to search for products, the sort data feature uses titles from the letters A to Z and vice versa and sort data from the cheapest to the most expensive price and vice versa, the product category feature for filtering data by category.

  The flow of using this application starts from the user looking for the item they want to buy, if the user has trouble finding the desired product, they can use the features provided, when they have put the item they want to buy into the cart the user can checkout the item via whatsapp so that the user can directly interact directly with the seller.
